This is a rewrite of my bash motd for FreeBSD operating system. This 
time in C, and it does not make uneccecary forks.

This version works on UFS only. If you try to run it on other fs, the 
quota usage won't be shown correctly. In next commits I will write it 
for ZFS, allowing the user to determine the filesystem with the 
makefile.
